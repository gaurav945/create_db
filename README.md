# DB instances on AWS & GCP using Terraform

Idea is to create basic DB instances (or with custom parameters) on our chosen environment using Terraform.

## Basic Setup

1. Install [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
2. Install [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-mac.html)
3. Install [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart)

Log into aws cli & gcloud on your local machine, so it doesnt interfere with Terraform's execution.
